# The purpose of this project is for education and awareness.
## We wanted to be able to visualize wash sale and trading volume data across NFT collections.
Currently, NFTs are a hot topic and have a lot of negative press regarding scams and wash sales.
By aggregating data over time and looking at each collection, we can see which collections are legit and which are pumped artifically.
This is for education purposes and to help make NFT trading data more visible and accessible.

This is a hackathon project that utilizes the ERC-721 Marketplace Subgraph created by DataNexus.
The subgraph monitors and indexes all ERC-721 transactions across OpenSea, X2Y2, and LooksRare

Unfortunately it seems that OpenSea recently migrated to their new SeaPort contract, so additional support is needed.
